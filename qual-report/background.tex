"The IoT integrates the interconnectedness of human culture -- our 'things' -- with the interconnectedness of our digital information system -- 'the internet.' That's the IoT," said Kevin Ashton, the coiner of the term "Internet of Things." The promise of IoT's ability to bridge human social dynamics and culture and technology helped to popularize its adoption in the 2000s. Shortly after, smart devices could be found everywhere: in the home, in the car, in the workplace. The Internet of Things had veritably exploded. 

However, with the ubiquity of IoT devices and the speed in which they were popularized, little emphasis was placed on security. Several high-profile attacks in which IoT devices were used as an attack vector brought attention to this critical issue. Default passwords, weak security measures, lack of updates, lack of an industry security standard, and weak/no encryption are among many of the security issues that continue to plague these devices. 

The CSAE ESC 2020 competition aims to bring attention to the need for increased security in IoT devices. Through the exploitation of the firmware of a custom IoT WiFi access point, we aim to show how attackers can compromise and leverage these devices for malicious ends.
