To complete this qualifier challenge, our team used GHIDRA, a reverse engineering tool, along with a riscv ghidra processor module to work backwards through an unfamiliar binary file to obtain the correct flag. For the first challenge, we collected the flag "CSEERA*.+,)". For the second, the flag "OPZPFOGEDY[_OOPS" was quickly obtained. For the final challenge, we built off of knowledge gained from the previous challenge and produced the flag "I0E;3.<2<3G<33C#". From the experiences gained through this qualifier, we feel well-adjusted to proceed with the firmware-level analysis and exploitation of different RISC-V programs.
